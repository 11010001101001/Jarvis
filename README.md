Jarvis is an intelligent voice assistant, a command-line python app with default settings for russian usage for personal convenience using gpt+SELERO+VOSK+pvporcupine neural networks.
How it was born? I was inspired by Haudi Ho developer and his voice assistant youtube videos. Thanks him a lot. 
As I am studying python, i made a challenge for myself: i decided to make my own voice assistant using only names of neural networks Haudi used. No source code, all by myself.



## Start
 - please configure CONFIG file first
 - go to .../Jarvis/VoiceAssistant/Body directory in terminal
 - launch Jarvis with command "python3 Launcher.py"



I will be glad if Jarvis will be useful for someone else 🌚
